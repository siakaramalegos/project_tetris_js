block based gaming

## How to Play

Just like traditional Tetris, your goal is place blocks to clear as many rows as possible. Game play is controlled with the following keys:

- **Down arrow**: move the current piece all the way down (fast)
- **Right arrow**: move the current piece one block to the right
- **Left arrow**: move the current piece one block to the left
- **Space bar**: (coming soon) rotate the piece
